    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/100k_square_dial.png" title="Dial Face Artwork" >
I made dial faces for a couple of the square gauges built
in <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/blog/2012/01/28/build-number-one/">Build Number One</a>.  Nearly
ready to install these guys.</p>

<p>Laying out the line-work on the square faces presents
an interesting challenge.  I decided to generate the
<a href="https://github.com/clearwater/gaugette/blob/master/tools/square_dial/dial.png">bare line-work</a>
programmatically with a <a href="https://github.com/clearwater/gaugette/blob/master/tools/square_dial/dial.rb">ruby script</a>, and add the labels later with
a graphics tool.</p>

<p>My first attempt at the script used the GD2 library, but <a href="http://gd2.rubyforge.org/rdoc/">GD2</a>
doesn&#8217;t seem to support anti-aliasing or line-caps and the resulting line-work
was just too damned ugly.  I switched to <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/cairo/">Cairo</a> which makes pretty, pretty lines.
A revelation at this point was that I could use Cairo&#8217;s clipping operator to trim the graticule lines and remove the messy trig I was coding to figure out line
intersections and stroke lengths.  Finally I imported the generated image into
OpenOffice to add the text labels.</p>

<p>So what to print on?  On a recent trip to Cairns I looked in Officeworks
for ideas.  I didn&#8217;t find any card stock I liked, but
I did find some 120 gsm paper (Quill brand &#8220;Metallique&#8221;
in Mother of Pearl) with a cool metallic / opalesque finish.
120 gsm is heavier than standard typing paper, and maybe barely stiff
enough to support itself in the gauge.  Over time it might curl
or slump in the varying humidity here in the tropics.
There is just enough drive shaft length to place the paper
over the original dial plate so that the needle just clears
the face, but if the paper will support itself I could
backlight it with an LED which might look nice in the dark.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/fiskars_hole_punch.png" title="Fiskars Hole Punch" >
One thing that had me stuffed is how to punch a neat hole in the paper for
the drive shaft.  A standard hole-punch is too big and can&#8217;t reach
far enough from the edge of the paper.  Drilling would leave messy edges.  Scouring
the aisles at Officeworks I found a
<a href="http://www.fiskarscraft.eu/Products/Craft/Punches/Eyelet-Setter/Eyelet-Setter-Pack">set of three eyelet setters</a> from Fiskars in the scrap-booking section.  The hole punches use a crazy spring-driven hammer mechanism, so you can position them anywhere on the page, pull back the hammer, and smack, you have a hole.  I was reckon I want a 3mm hole, and the middle
size is 3.2mm (1/8&#8221;).  The downside is the set of 3 cost about $25.  Anyway they work a treat and now
I have some crafty hole punches.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/finished_square_face.png" title="Custom Dial Face" >
I tried printing the dials with an ink-jet.  That
seemed okay until I mounted it in the gauge and I found
that at certain angles the metallic finish
on the paper made the line-work look really washed out.  Redoing
the printing with a laser printer gave much better results.</p>

<p>After installing the new face I calibrated it carefully and found
a discrepancy between the printed face and needle position that I can&#8217;t
explain.  If I line up zero precisely, then at full-scale (230 degrees
sweep) I find the needle is about 2 degrees short of the 100% mark on
the dial.  I&#8217;m not sure what the source of error is - presumably just measurement and positioning errors -  but it is easily
solved by changing the stepper motor sweep from 690 steps to 696 steps
to full-scale deflection.</p>

I&#8217;ve separated the Switec X25 motor driver code into a separate
library repository on GitHub.  This will make it easier to use
the driver library in other applications.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25">SwitecX25 Library</a></h2>

<p>This contains only the Switec X25 driver.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/clearwater/gaugette">Gaugette</a> </h2>

<p>This is an arduino application that controls analog
gauges by interpreting commands received over the serial interface.
To compile Gaugette you will now need to add the SwitecX25 library
to your Arduino libraries folder.</p>

    <id>http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/blog/2012/01/28/build-number-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/thermo_original.jpg" title="$5 Hygrometer" >
This weekend I opened up one of the cheap-but-funky thermometers/hygrometers
from <a href="http://www.letsmaketime.com.au">Lets Make Time</a>
and replaced the thermometer mechanism with the
Arduino-controlled Switec X25.168 stepper.</p>

<p>The thermometer and hygrometer are installed
in identical one-part plastic housings with no screws
or seams, so it wasn&#8217;t clear how to crack them open.
<img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/thermo_back.jpg" title="back removed" >
I used a Dremel to cut away the back panel giving access to the
thermometer mechanism, but to my surprise the dial face was still firmly
locked in place.  After a bit
of poking around I discovered that I could push the whole assembly out
forward - in fact the plastic lens is only held in by friction, and
the dial and mechanism are held in by the lens.  No cutting was
required.  #LFMF</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/thermo_disassembly.jpg"" title="thermometer disassembly" >
This turned out to be important because after careful measurement I realized
that the motor would have to be mounted snugly against the the back of the housing to
leave the drive shaft protruding enough to attach a needle.  The plastic panel I cut away
would have been ideal to screw the motor to.
Starting again with an undamaged housing, I gently pried out the plastic lens, removed the face and mechanism.
This time I only cut away enough plastic on the back to allow the drive shaft to pass through.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/thermo_mount.jpg" title="mechanism removal" >
The needle and the bi-metal thermometer coil came off the face easily enough, but the mounting for the coil
is a crafty two-piece deal that mounts through the centre of the dial.  It appeared to be
assembled a bit like a rivet, and a couple of solid blows from the back with a punch
released it cleanly from the dial face.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/thermo_glued.jpg" title="hot glue to the rescue" >
I originally intended to use screws to secure the stepper to the back of the housing, but
there isn&#8217;t much tolerance for positional
error, which made me nervous.  Instead I used the conical rivet-thingy to precisely align the motor drive shaft in hole in the dial and held it all in place while I hot-glued it to the back of the case.  Alignment was spot-on the the motor seems to be solidly secured.  So far so good.</p>

<p>Next I wired up the Arduino and zeroed the motor against the low stop and put the needle on.
There were some unexpected complications at this point.
The motor has a sweep of 315 degrees, but this dial only
allows about 230 degrees of needle movement.  I modified the library to support a
soft range limit to avoid exceeding 230 degrees, while still running through a full 315
degrees during reset.</p>

<p>While trying to calibrate the dial I found the needle slipping at times, especially under
vibration caused by the power-on reset or slow stepping.  With the needle slipping calibration
was impossible. I tried applying the smallest drop of hot glue I could manage to the back of the needle.  That really didn&#8217;t work - the tiny irregular mass between the needle and the dial face would sometimes
bind against the dial face, causing more problems.</p>

<p>I believe the needle hole is dished a little, so I removed the needle, cleaned the glue away,
and smacked it with a hammer to flatten out the dish and close up the hole.  That worked
a little too well and I had to ream the hole out a bit with a thumb tack.  Now the needle
is nice and snug, no slippage.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s how it looks assembled.  Calibration is slightly out, but I&#8217;m going to make
a new dial face anyway, so no need to sweat about that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/shiny_things.jpg" title="Pretty Shiny Things" >
I&#8217;ve been looking around on-line and in stores for some parts to
make some classy steam-punk gauges.
After a lot of searching I came
across <a href="http://www.letsmaketime.com.au">Lets Make Time</a>
here in Australia who carry clock and weather station
parts at very reasonable prices.
It&#8217;s always hard to gauge build quality from pictures, so I laid
down some cash and bought a grab bag of stuff.</p>

<p>The order arrived and it all looks great.
It was no surprise to find the rectangular gauges are made from
plastic and look a bit cheap, but I really love the retro shape
and they actually don&#8217;t look too bad.  I haven&#8217;t cut one open yet,
but from the outside everything looks great for my purposes.</p>

<p>The large lens is glass, with a metal rim, mounted over
a plastic frame.  I&#8217;m very pleased with it too.</p>

<p>The circular thermometers turned out to be the real gem in
this collection.  The outer ring is metal, and the lens is acrylic
but well finished and looks beautiful.  The printed dial seems to be made out
of metal too - maybe aluminium with a gold-coloured foil on both sides.
As an extra-happy bonus, the needle fits the shaft of the X25s so it
can be used with no modification.</p>

    <link href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/blog/2012/01/26/simplified-acceleration-model/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-26T09:42:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/blog/2012/01/26/simplified-acceleration-model</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The logic in the <code>advance()</code> function of the
<a href="https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25">Switec X25 library</a>
steps the motor forward or backward one step, then computes the delay in
microseconds until the next step is due.  This logic determines the acceleration curve and
maximum speed of the needle.  My first cut at this
code used floating point arithmetic to model this as time/accel/velocity problem.  The
motion was nice and smooth, but it was overkill, and consumes too many precious Arduino
compute cycles.  When driving multiple motors, this will create an artificial ceiling on the
maximum motor speed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve rewritten that logic to use a simple lookup table instead.
This is a fairly obvious approach, but it was
reassuring to see similar approaches recommended in both the
<a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/vid/2009111395111_Acceleration_&amp;_reset_calculation_example.pdf">VID 29 documentation</a>
and the <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/mcr/2010410104915847.pdf">MCR MR1107 data sheet</a>.</p>

<p>The acceleration curve is defined as pairs of vel,delay values:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned short accelTable[][2] = {
  {   10, 5000},
  {   30, 1500},
  {  100, 1000},
  {  150,  800},
  {  300,  600}
};
</code></pre>


<p>We maintain a variable <code>vel</code> (which isn&#8217;t actually velocity,
but is a surrogate for velocity) that increments
each step under acceleration, and decrements each step under deceleration.
When stationary, <code>vel</code> is zero.  After 1 step of acceleration it is 1.
For simplicity I&#8217;ve made the acceleration and deceleration curves identical
so they can share the same lookup table.</p>

<p>To determine the inter-step delay at any given value of <code>vel</code>, we find
the first table entry such that <code>accelTable[i][0] &lt; vel</code>.  In practice this means that the
motor will step at 5000 &micro;S intervals for 9 steps, then 1500 &micro;S
steps for the next 20 steps, 1000 &micro;S for the next 70 steps, and so on.
The peak speed with a delay of 600 &micro;S equates to 1666 Hz step rate
or about 500 degrees per second.</p>

<p>The motion control logic first determines if the motor is subject to acceleration,
at full speed, or deceleration and adjusts <code>vel</code> accordingly.  Using
steps as the unit for <code>vel</code> makes it very
easy to determine when to declerate: when <code>vel</code> is greater than or equal to the number of steps
to reach our destination, we need to start decelerating.</p>

<p>The new logic also ensures that if the motor is moving at
speed in one direction and is directed to a new position in the opposite direction it will
decelerate to a stop before accelerating in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The constants that make up the acceleration table are constrained by the
the inertia of the needle attached to the motor.  The
<a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/vid/2009111395111_Acceleration_&amp;_reset_calculation_example.pdf">VID 29 documentation</a>
gives some recommendations for calculating these values, but I actually
didn&#8217;t use that.  I experimented until I
found values that were within operational limits and look nice to me.</p>

<p>I tested this code driving 3 motors simultaneously with an Arduino Uno.
All good.  New code is in the <a href="https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25">library on Github</a>.</p>

    <id>http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/blog/2012/01/24/attack-of-the-switec-clones</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/X25_clone.png" title="Switec Clones" >
When my eBay Switec X25.168 motors arrived, they didn&#8217;t look at all like
the white motors with the &#8220;Switec&#8221; branding that I&#8217;ve been seeing
online.  I finally got around to tracking down what exactly they are.
They have two identification numbers printed black on black:
<code>vid29-02p</code> and <code>d11455db</code>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/VID29_diagram.png" title="Motor Diagram" >
It turns out that the first number is the model, and these are in reality VID29 series stepper motors
from <a href="http://www.vid.wellgain.com/product.aspx">Hong Kong VID</a>.  Interestingly their
<a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/vid/20091026113525_VID29_manual_EN-080606.pdf">data sheet</a>
includes details of recommended acceleration characteristics to bring the motors
to full speed without visible and audible jitter.  Cool cool cool.</p>

<p>Armed with that information
I turned up what appears to be a third manufacturer, <a href="http://www.mcrmotor.com/en/">MCR Motor</a> who
call this motor the MR1108.  The MCR <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/mcr/2010410104720473.pdf">data sheet</a>
lists the Switec and VID motors as alternatives.</p>

<p>The eBay seller had these marked unambiguously as X25.168 motors in their auction, but didn&#8217;t
specifically say they were from Switec.  I wonder if any of the eBay offers are actual Switec motors?</p>

connect two motors to the Arduino.  Once concern
I have is that the control logic that manages the acceleration and

floating point logic with a lookup table, but for now I like being
able to easily fiddle with the motion parameters.</p>

<p>It turns out that two motors work pretty well with only minor tweaks to the existing
code.</p>

describes the X12 family of driver chips which allow

I like the look of these for keeping the I/O count down, and offloading
a bunch of processing from the Arduino.</p>

<p>However I have been unable to find a supplier for X12 quad driver chips.
It seems that they were available until recently
from Swatch subsidiary Microcomponents Ltd. at microcomponents.ch,

<p>My first cut at the <a href="https://github.com/clearwater/gaugette">Switec X25 library</a>
stepped the needle at a constant speed.  You can see the constant speed
motion in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwAxRk_5oXA">original video</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve updated the library to support acceleration and deceleration, partly because
it seems more aesthetically pleasing, and partly because I have a notion that
I should be able to reach faster peak speeds by ramping the speed up.  Motion is
now specified by 4 parameters: minimum speed, maximum speed, acceleration, deceleration.</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;ve used floating point calculations to compute each step period
standard Newtonian velocity/distance/time
calculations.  This works okay, but is unnecessarily compute-intensive.</p>

<p>The Switec X25 library supports multiple motors
and no doubt this computation will become a factor when I try to drive more than
one motor, so I&#8217;ll have to address that at some point.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of the control logic is that the calculations are done at the start
of each step, in distance-domain rather than in time domain like most simulations.
This means the calculations must be done more frequently at higher needle
speeds.  This is going to set an upper bound on maximum step rate.</p>

<p>When it does become an issue,
I think I could replace the entire floating point calculation with a small table of pre-computed
(step-count, step-period) pairs with little perceptible difference.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Wiring It Up</h2>

<p>Given the comments by <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1260978962">Toby Catlin</a>
about cooking the motors while soldering, I opted to make up a harness with a connector rather than
soldering directly to the motor.
The pins on each winding exactly match the spacing of the first and fourth pins
of a standard 0.1&#8221; connector.  JST RE connectors are the right pitch, but the pins on the motor are
too short and too narrow to engage with the connectors.  For my first harness I cut up
a floppy disk cable connector into two 4-hole sections and soldered wire to the first and fourth
pins.  It worked fine but it is pretty bulky, and the metal contacts in the connector did not solder
very easily.  For now I just pushed the tinned ends of the wires directly into the Arduino connectors.</p>

<p>I wrote some code for the Arduino to step the motor using the IO pattern established
in <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1260978962">this post</a>
and a quick ruby script to query my pfSense firewall to get some live data to test with.</p>

<p>Add some duct tape for a gauge, and behold the simplest analog bandwidth meter ever:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gaugette is a project detailing the construction of custom analog gauges using
an Arduino microcontroller and Switec X25.168 stepper motors.
Each motor requires 4 digital I/O pins,
and a single Arduino can drive three motors.  The limit
is purely due to Aruidno limit of 14 digital I/O lines.</p>

<p>Source code for the project is available on

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>After playing with the
<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/171">motor shield party pack</a> from Adafruit,
I started thinking it would be fun to have a couple of analog gauges
mounted on the wall somewhere to show system health indication; maybe network bandwidth or
web traffic?

Of course I&#8217;ve seen the very beautiful
<a href="http://blog.skytee.com/2010/11/torrentmeter-a-steampunk-bandwidth-meter/">TorrentMeter by Skytee</a>
which is so pretty it makes me weep, but beautiful brass antique voltmeters are in short supply
around here.</p>

<p>The servos and steppers in the Adafruit pack aren&#8217;t ideal for driving gauges.  The little stepper they
include runs really hot.  The servo seemed
like possibility and it is driven by PWM, so I wouldn&#8217;t even need the motor shield.
But it is quite bulky and noisy, so I started looking for something better.</p>

<h2>The Switec X25 Stepper Motor</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/Switec_X25_168.jpg" title="Switec X26.168 Stepper Motor" >
I noticed a lot of sellers on eBay selling tiny Switec X25
motors as replacements for GM auto instrument clusters.  They were developed
by the technology arm of Swatch, so I figured they should be low power and
pretty quiet.  Certainly they are cheap; under $5 each!</p>

<p>The X25 motors have 6 steps per revolution, and a 180:1 gearbox, giving a
resolution of 1/3 degree.
The <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/switec/X25_xxx_01_SP_E-1.pdf">data sheet</a>
indicates they draw no more than 20mA per winding, which is low enough to source directly from the 5V
Arduino data pins, raising the possibility of driving these without an intermediate controller chip. Yes, I
understand the risks associated with wiring inductive loads directly to the microcontroller.  Arduinos are
cheap, why not try it?</p>

<p>On the net I found an excellent
<a href="http://www.mycockpit.org/forums/content.php/355-An-Easy-Approach-to-an-Analog-Gauge">overview of the Switec X25 by Mike Powell</a>.
Mike expresses concerns about driving inductive loads directly from the microcontroller and uses
an external L293D driver.  There is an intriguing
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1260978962">thread by Toby Catlin</a>
which approaches the issue of driving these without a controller, but the thread ends abruptly at the point
where he sees the first signs of success.  What happens next?  Blue smoke?</p>

<p>At the price I figured it was worth a shot driving these directly,
so I ordered 6 from  <a href="http://stores.ebay.com.au/partsangel">one of many</a>
eBay stores selling them.  Apparently a complete GM instrument cluster has 6 motors, so 6 is a popular quantity.
In all it cost about $25 including postage from the US to Australia.
At the time of writing they carry both the X25.168
with rear contacts, and the X25.589 with front contacts and a longer indicator shaft.
Both have internal stops.  See the <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/switec/ISM_Buyers_Guide.pdf">buyers guide</a> for details
on the different models.</p>
