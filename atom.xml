    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I built a pair of improved wiring harnesses so I could
connect two motors to the Arduino.  Once concern
I have is that the control logic that manages the acceleration and
deceleration could be so slow that it will interfere with the motor
drive signalling when trying to control more than one motor.  I have in mind to replace the
floating point logic with a lookup table, but for now I like being
able to easily fiddle with the motion parameters.</p>

<p>It turns out that two motors work pretty well with only minor tweaks to the existing
code.</p>

The <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/X25_xxx_01_SP_E-1.pdf">X25 data sheet</a>
describes the X12 family of driver chips which allow
up to 4 Switec motors to be controlled over a 3-wire serial interface.
I like the look of these for keeping the I/O count down, and offloading
a bunch of processing from the Arduino.</p>

<p>However I have been unable to find a supplier for X12 quad driver chips.
It seems that they were available until recently
from Swatch subsidiary Microcomponents Ltd. at microcomponents.ch,
but after Swatch
<a href="http://www.swatchgroup.com/en/services/archive/2009/swatch_group_sale_of_microcomponents_automotive_business_activities_to_juken_technology">sold the stepping motor business</a>
to Singapore-based <a href="http://www.jukenswisstech.com">Juken Techonology</a> in 2009,
that website disappeared.</p>

<p>My first cut at the <a href="https://github.com/clearwater/gaugette">SwitecX25 library</a>
stepped the needle at a constant speed.  You can see the constant speed
motion in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwAxRk_5oXA">original video</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve updated the library to support acceleration and deceleration, partly because
it seems more aesthetically pleasing, and partly because I have a notion that
I should be able to reach faster peak speeds by ramping the speed up.  Motion is
now specified by 4 parameters: minimum speed, maximum speed, acceleration, deceleration.</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;ve used floating point calculations to compute each step period
standard newtonian velocity/distance/time
calculations.  This works okay, but is unnecessarily compute-intensive.</p>

<p>The SwitecX25 library supports multiple motors
and no doubt this compuation will become a factor when I try to drive more than
one motor, so I&#8217;ll have to address that at some point.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of the control logic is that the calculations are done at the start
of each step, in distance-domain rather than in time domain like most simulations.
This means the calculations must be done more frequently at higher needle
speeds.  This is going to set an upper bound on maximum step rate.</p>

<p>When it does become an issue,
I think I could replace the entire floating point calculation with a small table of pre-computed
(step-count, step-period) pairs with little perceptible difference.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Wiring It Up</h2>

<p>Given the comments by <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1260978962">Toby Catlin</a>
about cooking the motors while soldering, I opted to make up a harness with a connector rather than
soldering directly to the motor.
The pins on each winding exactly match the spacing of the first and fourth pins
of a standard 0.1&#8221; connector.  JST RE connectors are the right pitch, but the pins on the motor are
too short and too narrow to engage with the connectors.  For my first harness I cut up
a floppy disk cable connector into two 4-hole sections and soldered wire to the first and fourth
pins.  It worked fine but it is pretty bulky, and the metal contacts in the connector did not solder
very easily.  For now I just pushed the tinned ends of the wires directly into the Arduino connectors.</p>

<p>I wrote some code for the Arduino to step the motor using the IO pattern established
in <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1260978962">this post</a>
and a quick ruby script to query my pfSense firewall to get some live data to test with.</p>

<p>Add some duct tape for a gauge, and behold the simplest analog bandwidth meter ever:</p>

    <id>http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/blog/2012/01/05/what-is-gaugette</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gaugette is an Arduino library for controlling Switec X25.168 stepper motors
directly from the Arduino data IO lines.  Each motor requires 4 digital IO pins,
and a single arduino can drive multiple motors.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-f4m18n48I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The source code for the library, and some sample client code is available from the
<a href="https://github.com/clearwater/gaugette">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>After playing with the
<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/171">motor shield party pack</a> from Adafruit,
I started thinking it would be fun to have a couple of analog gauges
mounted on the wall somewhere to show system health indication; maybe network bandwidth or
web traffic?  Of course I&#8217;ve seen the very beautiful
<a href="http://blog.skytee.com/2010/11/torrentmeter-a-steampunk-bandwidth-meter/">TorrentMeter by Skytee</a>
which just makes me weep, but I don&#8217;t have a beautiful brass antique voltmeter to go that route.</p>

<p>The servos and steppers in the Adafruit pack aren&#8217;t ideal for driving gauges.  The little stepper they
include runs really hot.  The servo seemed
like possibility and it is driven by PWM, so I wouldn&#8217;t even need the motor shield.
But it is quite bulky and noisy, so I started looking for something better.</p>

<h2>The Switec X25 Stepper Motor</h2>

<p><img alt="Switec X26.168 Stepper Motor" src="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/Switec_X25_168.jpg" align="right">
I noticed a lot of sellers on ebay selling tiny Switec X25
motors as replacements for GM auto instrument clusters.  They were developed
by the technology arm of Swatch, so I figured they should be low power and
pretty quiet.  Certainly they are cheap; under $5 each!</p>

<p>The X25 motors have 6 steps per revolution, and a 180:1 gearbox, giving a
resolution of 1/3 degree.
The <a href="X25_xxx_01_SP_E-1.pdf">spec sheet</a>
indicates they draw no more than 20mA per winding, which is low enough to source directly from the 5V
Arduno data pins, raising the possibility of driving these without an intermediate controller chip. Yes, I
understand the risks associated with wiring inductive loads directly to the microcontroller.  Arduinos are
cheap, why not try it?</p>

<p>On the net I found an excellent
<a href="http://www.mycockpit.org/forums/content.php/355-An-Easy-Approach-to-an-Analog-Gauge">overview of the Switech X25 by Mike Powell</a>.
Mike expresses concerns about driving inductive loads directly from the microcontroller and uses
an external L293D driver.  There is an intruiging
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1260978962">thread by Toby Catlin</a>
which approaches the issue of driving these without a controller, but the thread ends abruptly at the point
where he sees the first signs of success.  What happens next?  Blue smoke?</p>

<p>At the price I figured it was worth a shot driving these directly,
so I ordered 6 from  <a href="http://stores.ebay.com.au/partsangel">one of many</a>
ebay stores selling them.  Apparently a complete GM instrument cluster has 6 motors, so 6 is a popular quantity.
In all it cost about $25 including postage from the US to Australia.
At the time of writing they carry both the X25.168
with rear contacts, and the X25.589 with front contacts and a longer indicator shaft.
Both have internal stops.  See the <a href="http://clearwater.github.com/gaugette/resources/ISM_Buyers_Guide.pdf">buyers guide</a> for details
on the different models.</p>
